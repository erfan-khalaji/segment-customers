# Machine Learning Session II: ML in Practice

## Overview
- Project: Customer Segmentation and Churn Prediction
- Tools: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Keras, Flask

## Flow of the Session:
1. Unsupervised Learning: Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering
2. Dimensionality Reduction with PCA
3. Churn Prediction using Ensemble Methods
4. Neural Networks for Churn Prediction with Keras
5. Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV and RandomSearchCV)
6. Model Deployment using Flask

Dataset: Custom E-commerce Customer Data
